Java tool for taking HTML + CSS and getting HTML with inlined CSS!


_This library will ideally be interchangeable with different CSS and HTML reader and parser libraries, but is currently dependent upon the good people at Phloc (danke)._

What does 'Brolson' mean?
-------------------------
'Brolson' is a portmanteau of 'brothers' and 'Olson'.  The Olson brothers patented an inline rollerskate design known to the world as Rollerblade.I'm paying tribute to fellow Minnesotans via an obscure reference to a fad to the 90s.  Clever, no?
